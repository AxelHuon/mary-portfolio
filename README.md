Project Structure

Here is a general overview all inside of `src`:

-   `app/`: Contains the application's page files. Each file represents a route.

-   `components/`: Folder for reusable React components.
    -   **Atomic Design:**
        -   `Atoms`: The smallest, basic building blocks of the application, such as buttons, input fields, or any other standalone UI elements.
        -   `Molecules`: Groups of atoms bonded together to represent slightly more complex UI components, like a search box combining a text input atom with a button atom.
        -   `Organisms`: Complex UI components consisting of groups of molecules and possibly atoms as well. Examples include entire sections of a page like a header.
        -   `Templates`: Contains section parts of Pages.

Also put the style in `styled-components` inside a file like `component-name.style.ts` or directly inside `component-name.tsx`.

-   `public/`: For static files such as images.
-   `utils/`: Utility functions to assist in various tasks.
-   `hooks/`: Custom React hooks for reusable logic across components or pages.
-   `context/`: Custom React context.

## üß∞ 5. Techno and lib

### Styling

We use `styled-components` for styling with a SSR loading of CSS.

### GSAP

This project uses GSAP, a robust JavaScript tool that allows rich animation effects. We have also incorporated the GSAP Premium version to leverage more advanced animation capabilities that enhance the user experience.

#### Install GSAP

Add the following to your `.npmrc` file either for your profile or at the root of your project:

```bash
always-auth=true
//npm.greensock.com/:_authToken=${TOKEN}
@gsap:registry=https://npm.greensock.com
```

Then the first time that you install GSAP to a project you need to install via:

```bash
npm install gsap@npm:@gsap/shockingly
```

After the first time you can install via the normal commands.

```bash
npm install
```

### File Extensions

We use `TypeScript` for all files extensions, so we have only `*.tsx` or `*.ts` files.

## üë• 6. Contributing

This project utilizes a structured approach within our Git workflow, focusing on two main branches: `master` and `dev`, alongside a specific nomenclature for branches and commits. Understanding the purpose, use, and naming conventions of these elements is crucial for effective collaboration and contribution to the project.

### Branches Overview

-   **`master` Branch**: Represents the production-ready state of our project. It's stable and deployable at all times. Updates are made through a controlled process of code reviews and extensive testing to ensure the production environment's reliability and stability.

-   **`dev` Branch**: Serves as the primary development branch. All new features, enhancements, and non-critical bug fixes are merged into `dev` first, maintaining an active development environment that's separate from the production system, thereby allowing continuous development without compromising production stability.

### Naming Conventions

#### Branch Naming

Branch names should be descriptive, reflecting the purpose of the work. They should be prefixed by the type of work (`feat`, `fix`, `opti`), followed by a concise description. For example, `feat/use-auth-hook` for a new authentication feature.

#### Commit Messages

Commit messages should follow the format `[type]: commit message`, where `[type]` indicates the nature of the change (`feat`, `fix`, `opti`), and `commit message` provides a clear description of the changes.

### Contributing to the Project

Contributions are warmly welcomed. To contribute effectively, adhere to the following guidelines:

-   **Branching**: Always create a new branch from `dev` for your work. This ensures contributions are based on the latest development efforts. The branch name should accurately reflect the work being undertaken.

-   **Pull Requests**: Submit a pull request (PR) against the `dev` branch upon completing your feature or fix. Ensure the PR title and description succinctly describe the changes and their motivations.

-   **Code Review**: PRs require approval before merging into `dev`. This maintains quality standards and adherence to the project's coding practices and architectural decisions.

-   **Adherence to Standards**: Contributions must respect the project's architecture and coding conventions. Consistency is vital for maintaining quality and ease of maintenance.

By following these guidelines and naming conventions, we foster a more organized, navigable, and understandable project structure, facilitating smoother project management and collaboration.
